## Installation

1. Install the [stock management backend module](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-module-stockmanagement) on your OpenMRS server
2. Add the frontend module to your distribution by following the [O3 configuration, setup and deployment guide](https://openmrs.atlassian.net/wiki/x/YgabAQ)
3. Configure initial settings:

   - Define stock items and sources
   - Configure user roles and permissions

## Configuration

The following configuration options are available for customization:

### Essential Configuration Options

These must be configured to match your OpenMRS concept dictionary. These UUIDs link the stock management system to the appropriate concepts in your OpenMRS installation:

- **`packagingUnitsUUID`** - UUID of the concept set containing packaging unit options (e.g., "Box", "Bottle", "Strip"). Used when defining how stock items are packaged for storage and distribution.

- **`dispensingUnitsUUID`** - UUID of the concept set for dispensing units (e.g., "Tablet", "ml", "Capsule"). Used when dispensing stock items to patients or other locations.

- **`stockAdjustmentReasonUUID`** - UUID of the concept set containing reasons for stock adjustments (e.g., "Expired", "Damaged", "Lost", "Found"). Required for tracking why stock levels were manually adjusted.

- **`stockTakeReasonUUID`** - UUID of the concept set for stock take reasons (e.g., "Routine Count", "Audit", "Investigation"). Used during physical inventory reconciliation processes.

- **`stockSourceTypeUUID`** - UUID of the concept set defining types of stock sources (e.g., "Supplier", "Pharmacy", "Ward"). Used to categorize where stock comes from or goes to.

- **`stockItemCategoryUUID`** - UUID of the concept set for categorizing stock items (e.g., "Drug", "Medical Supply", "Laboratory Supply"). Used for organizing and filtering stock items.

```json
{
  "packagingUnitsUUID": "bce2b1af-98b1-48a2-98a2-3e4ffb3c79c2",
  "dispensingUnitsUUID": "162402AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA",
  "stockAdjustmentReasonUUID": "47f0825e-8648-47c2-b847-d3197ed6bb72",
  "stockTakeReasonUUID": "47f0825e-8648-47c2-b847-d3197ed6bb72",
  "stockSourceTypeUUID": "2e1e8049-9cbe-4a2d-b1e5-8a91e5d7d97d",
  "stockItemCategoryUUID": "6d24eb6e-b42f-4706-ab2d-ae4472161f6a"
}
```

### Display & Behavior Options

- **`useItemCommonNameAsDisplay`** _(default: true)_ - When true, displays the common name of stock items in the UI. When false, displays the drug name instead. Useful for sites that prefer clinical vs. common terminology.

- **`autoPopulateResponsiblePerson`** _(default: false)_ - When enabled, automatically fills in the currently logged-in user as the responsible person for stock operations. Saves time for single-user workflows but may not be appropriate for multi-user scenarios.

- **`enablePrintButton`** _(default: true)_ - Controls whether print buttons appear in the stock management interface. Set to false if printing capabilities are not needed or if using custom printing solutions.

- **`printItemCost`** _(default: false)_ - When enabled, includes item costs on printed reports and documents. Enable only if cost information should be visible on printed materials.

- **`printBalanceOnHand`** _(default: false)_ - When enabled, includes current stock balance information on printed reports. Useful for inventory tracking but may not be needed for all report types.

```json
{
  "useItemCommonNameAsDisplay": true,
  "autoPopulateResponsiblePerson": false,
  "enablePrintButton": true,
  "printItemCost": false,
  "printBalanceOnHand": false
}
```

### Organization Branding

Customize the appearance of printed reports and system branding:

- **`logo.src`** - Path or URL to your organization's logo image. Will be displayed on printed reports and system headers.

- **`logo.alt`** _(default: "Logo")_ - Alternative text for the logo image, shown on hover and for accessibility.

- **`logo.name`** - Organization name displayed when the logo image is unavailable or not set.

```json
{
  "logo": {
    "src": "/images/my-organization-logo.png",
    "alt": "My Healthcare Organization Logo",
    "name": "My Healthcare Organization"
  }
}
```

Refer to the [OpenMRS frontend configuration guide](https://openmrs.atlassian.net/wiki/x/nAP-C) for how to apply these settings.
